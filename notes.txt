#############################################################################

## Introduction 
## 


## Why cloud technology is revolutionizing business
## 

# What is cloud
    - network of datacenters >> "cloud"
    - leverage global scale compute and data platforms

# Danger of maintaining the status quo
    - burning platform effect 
    - adopt new technology and execute paradigm shift
    nintendo: from card games to video games
    vs. encyclopedia (to wikipedia)

# Paradigm shift
    - shifts CapEx to OpEx
    - smart assistants
    - IoT
    - Analytics >> Predictions >> intent

# Extraordinary compute power
    -  TPU: Tensor Processing Unit (1 day to 30min)

# Data as currency
    - machine learning



## Digital Transformation with Google Cloud
## 

# Enhancing productivity and collaboration
    - size and scale is not a differentiator (due to cloud)
    - culture and technology
