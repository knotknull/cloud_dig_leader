                                ->> central to creating a culture of innovation  ## TAKE NOTE
        - Innovation
            - embrace new technolgoy
            - new methods / process
            innovation is a balance between freedom and constraint  ## TAKE NOTE


# Scale the innovation mindset
    3 Rules 
        - Focus on user / customer 
        - Think 10x
        - Launch and iterate (Continuous Learning)

    Focus on user:
        - includes employees 

    User Expectation
        - Access         --------------+
              - Faster / Always On     |
        - Engagement                   |______  What Does Customer Expect
              - Valued Content         |
        - Customization                |
           - Adaptable Product/Service |
        - Communication                |
           - 2-way feedback            |
                - including employees  |
                          -------------+

# Think 10X
    - transformation over improvement 

# Launch and iterate
    - constinuous learning 
        - fail fast
    - figure out solution from by iterating / experimentation
        - don't look for perfect solution first
        - try -> learn -> try
    - correlation between innovative teams and high psychological safety ratesa ## TAKE NOTE
            - ask questions, take risks, challenge each other, build

    More Ideas You Try, The More You Learn

# Example
    - Banking 


What is your Why?
How meeting user expectations ?
How to use technology to serve users 10X ?
How can launch and interate more often?

Summary

- cloud compute + new / large amounts of data == new value
- early adopters are disrupting
- realtime / anywhere services

## The Value of Data 
## 

#  The role of data in digital transformation
Data == any information used by a business

- cloud offers:
    - economies of scale
    - rapid elasticity
    - automation
    - data access

#  Leveraging data in your organization

 - identify and map data
 data map: data in end to end business process
    - user data     : transactions, returns, footfall
    - corporate data: staffing, delivery, sales, staff structures
    - industry data : trends, purchasing patterns, research papers

Action:  look at intersections of data sets


#  Understanding data types
    Structured
        - organized 
        - can be put in database
    Unstructured
        - unorganized
            - documents, audio, images, videos
        - can be stored as objects  >> BLOB
            - data
            - metadata
            - identifier

    Bloomberg >> translates using Google Translate


#  Important data considerations
    - responibly capture data
    - Watch for human bias!!



## Data Consolidation and Analytics
## 

#  Migrating data to the cloud
    Greater Data ROI when in cloud (?)

    on prem:    
        - costly
        - inelastic

    cloud :    
        - rent compute / storage
        - elastic
        - real-time ingestion
        - TB of data

#  Cloud Databases
    - organized collection of data / tables 
    - scale
    - integrity

    - Cloud SQL
        - fully managed RDBMS 
        - storage scales automatically

    - Cloud Spanner
        - fully managed database service 
        - global scale
        - data automatically copied across regions
        - strong consistency

    - analysis of large / multi-dimensional datasets

    - Big Query
        - fully managed datawarehouse
        - maintenance / scaling
        - petabytes
        - serverless    
            - compute is provided automatically at query time   
                - do not pay for compute when not running queries

    - Pub/Sub
        - ingestion of data

    - Dataflow
        - processing of data


#  Cloud Data lakes 
    - repository for structure, semi-structure, unstructured data

        - nearline: access 1x per month
        - coldline: access 1x per 90 days
        - archive:  access 1x per year

#  Business Intelligence solutions
    - Looker: BI solution   
        - sits on top of analytics db


    - ex. gaming analytics 
        - features used
        - where players stuck
        - player lifetime value

    - Looker can utilize data warehouses i.e. Big Query

## Innovation with Machine Learning
## 

#  What is machine learning?

 Artificial Intelligence: machine capable of task that normally requires human intelligence
    - visual perception 
    - speech recognition
    - translation

 Machine Learning: computers that learn from data, make predictions, decisions without 
          being programmed to do so.  Algorithms to analyze data.


ML: Standard Algorithms  / Models to analyze data to derive predictive insights make repeated decisions at scale  
    Teach computer to solve problems by feeding correct answers


#  Data Quality
    - qualities of good data
        - coverage: scope and all possible scenarios
        - clean   : data consistency
                i.e. dirty data:  various timestamp formats
        - complete: availability of sufficient data to replace human knowledge
                incomplete (missing) data can affect model performance


#  AI and ML with Google Cloud

    Do you have your own training data ?
        +----> NO:  Pre-trained APIs
        |
        +----> Yes --->  Are you wirting the model code yourself?
                                    +----> No  ---> AutoML (Vertex AI)
                                    |
                                    +----> Yes ---> Custom Model tooling (Vertx AI)

    - Pre-trained APIs
        -  ML models for analyzing: images, videos, text
                - can be deployed to: on-prem, private cloud, google cloud 

        4 Types:
            - sight:
                - Vision API: pre-trained models to detect: faces, objects, text, sentiment
                                    - use Vision API to assign labels to images + classify
            - language
                - Natual Language API: discovers syntax, entities and sentiment  + classifies (complaints, praise, more info)

            - conversation
            - structured data

        Vertex uses google cloud services to build ML under one unified UI 
            - train existing ML model
            - build custom ML model


    AutoML (Vertex AI):  Apply data to existing pre-trained model

        - build / deploy custom ML models that:
                - analyze and categorize documents 
                - identify entities
                - asses attitudes (sentiment ?)

         [--]       <<-- Machine Learning :  ML + Data Science + Prototyping / Experiments
      [-------]     <<-- Data Analytics   :  Data Lakes + Data warehouses
    [------------]  <<-- IT Infrastructure:  Apps + Data Management



#  Real-world use cases for ML

    - 4 Common ML Business Problems     
        1. Replacing rule-based systems
        2. Automating processes
        3. Understanding unstructured data 
        4. Personalizing applications 

  Rule-based systems i.e. Search
    - RankBrain (ML)
        - continually improve


  Automated processing 
    - sale handover
        - Google Speech to Text API


  Understanding unstructured data  (images, video, audio)

# Infrastructure Modernizaton
 - On Prem / Legacy is not a differentiator 
    - Colocation:  rent part of a datacenter

  Virtual Machine: 
    - better use of resources
    - still a physical capacity limit

  Cloud:
    - Infrastructure as a Service
    - Planform as a Service


# Understanding compute options in the cloud
 Cloud:
   - on demand self services
   - broad network access
   - resource pooling
   - rapid elasticity
   - measured service

 3 Ways to mondernize Infrastructure 
   - VM 
   - Containers
   - Serverless

 Hypervisor: between physical and virtual machines

 Container virtualizes the OS
     - more lightweight
     - less memory
     - predicatble env

Kubernetes: open source cluster management system
            automated container orchestration
            - improve app reliability
            - faster / agile app development

serverless computing
    - provisioned automatically


# Hybrid and multi cloud
 - private cloud: VMs in a private data center
 - hybrid cloud : Combo of private and public
 - multi cloud  : multiple public cloud providers
 

 Open APIs:
    - Cloud Bigtable
    - Cloud Dataproc

 Open Source:
    - TensorFlow
    - Kubernetes

Anthos:
    - build once, run everywhere (really ??)

Network:
 - secure / 40% of world's traffic daily
 - global network 
   - 200 countries 
   - 20  regions 
   - 130 points of access

 Google cloud matches datacenter with renewable energy
    - reduces CO2 for computing
