                          -------------+

# Think 10X
    - transformation over improvement 

# Launch and iterate
    - constinuous learning 
        - fail fast
    - figure out solution from by iterating / experimentation
        - don't look for perfect solution first
        - try -> learn -> try
    - correlation between innovative teams and high psychological safety ratesa ## TAKE NOTE
            - ask questions, take risks, challenge each other, build

    More Ideas You Try, The More You Learn

# Example
    - Banking 


What is your Why?
How meeting user expectations ?
How to use technology to serve users 10X ?
How can launch and interate more often?

    - qualities of good data
        - coverage: scope and all possible scenarios
        - clean   : data consistency
                i.e. dirty data:  various timestamp formats
        - complete: availability of sufficient data to replace human knowledge
                incomplete (missing) data can affect model performance


#  AI and ML with Google Cloud

    Do you have your own training data ?
        +----> NO:  Pre-trained APIs
        |
        +----> Yes --->  Are you wirting the model code yourself?
                                    +----> No  ---> AutoML (Vertex AI)
                                    |
                                    +----> Yes ---> Custom Model tooling (Vertx AI)

    - Pre-trained APIs
        -  ML models for analyzing: images, videos, text
                - can be deployed to: on-prem, private cloud, google cloud 

        4 Types:
            - sight:
                - Vision API: pre-trained models to detect: faces, objects, text, sentiment
                                    - use Vision API to assign labels to images + classify
            - language
                - Natual Language API: discovers syntax, entities and sentiment  + classifies (complaints, praise, more info)

# Infrastructure Modernizaton
 - On Prem / Legacy is not a differentiator 
    - Colocation:  rent part of a datacenter

  Virtual Machine: 
    - better use of resources
    - still a physical capacity limit

  Cloud:
    - Infrastructure as a Service
    - Planform as a Service


# Understanding compute options in the cloud
 Cloud:
   - on demand self services
   - broad network access
   - resource pooling
   - rapid elasticity
   - measured service

 3 Ways to mondernize Infrastructure 
   - VM 
   - Containers
   - Serverless

 Hypervisor: between physical and virtual machines

 Container virtualizes the OS
     - more lightweight
     - less memory
     - predicatble env

Kubernetes: open source cluster management system
            automated container orchestration
            - improve app reliability
            - faster / agile app development

serverless computing
    - provisioned automatically


# Hybrid and multi cloud
 - private cloud: VMs in a private data center
 - hybrid cloud : Combo of private and public
 - multi cloud  : multiple public cloud providers
 

 Open APIs:
    - Cloud Bigtable
    - Cloud Dataproc

 Open Source:
    - TensorFlow
    - Kubernetes

Anthos:
    - build once, run everywhere (really ??)

Network:
 - secure / 40% of world's traffic daily
 - global network 
   - 200 countries 
   - 20  regions 
   - 130 points of access

 Google cloud matches datacenter with renewable energy
    - reduces CO2 for computing


# Google Cloud Compute Solutions

VM:
    - Compute Engine 
        - VMs
            - ex. Spotify used Compute Engine to scale

    - Google Cloud VMWare Engine 
       - managed VMWare service
            - manages infrastructure, networking management services
            - ex. Deutsche Borse Group
                - new private cloud in 40 minutes

    - Bare Metal 
        - 

Conainer
    - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
        - deploy / manage / scale
        - cluster of compute engine instances 


Serverless computing
    - AppEngine 
        - Platform as a Service / Cloud Computing Platform 
            - develop and host web apps
        - managed serverless platform
            - ex. IDEXX: VetConnect 

    - CloudRun 
        - build and deploy any langs
        - instantly scale up and down
            - ex. Veolia 

    - CloudFunctions 
        - build and connect cloud services
        - Function as a Service
            - zero server management  
            - ex. Lucille Games


## Modernizing Applications with Google Cloud
## 


# Cloud Change Patterns
5 Patterns:
    1. Move apps first and then change them later
            - lift / shift / change
    2. Change apps before they move
            - make modernization changes on prem first
    3. Invent in greenfield 
            - new infra in cloud  
    4. Invent in brownfield 
            - build in cloud, replace on prem when ready
    5. Move apps without any changes 
            - lift / shift 
            - upgrade infra only (more storage)
            - DR


# Challenges in app dev
    - on prem problems > cloud problems
    - cloud == NO LEGACY
    - decompose monoliths to microservices
    - CI / CD
    - High Velocity Delivery

# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
    - kubernetes: container orchestration system / Open Source
        - deployment 
        - scaling 
        - management

GKE: Google Managed Service for Containers
    - deploy / update / manage 


# App Engine
     - scalable web apps and mobile backends 
     - infrastructure is managed ( no servers )
     - App Engine will scale depending on traffic

ex. EDP: power utility 
         > 400 apps
        legacy mobile app migrated to App Engine



## The Value of APIs
## 

# Legacy System Challenges
    ex. HR / Banking /  Government /  DB / Datawarehouse
    - Does not integrate with IoT or Mobile
    - Batch based

# How APIs can modernize legacy systems
     -  software that enable integration between systems / services
     -  unlock value without rearchitecting / rebuilding

# Using APIs to create new business vlaue
    - digital ecosystem 
    - create / monetize services

ex. Walgreens 
    - Photo development
        - film to phone printing
    - Created APIs to print from phone
    - API was a product

ex. Monex 
    - financial services
    - API to simplify creating new services
    - Published API
    - Couldn't handle onprem / used Apigee

# Apigee
    - legacy system of record cannot keep up with rate of change for apps

        - secure
        - scale
        - manage
        - connect
        - analyze

    Apigee:
        - API Services
        - Developer Services
        - Analytics Services

    ex.  Chile Ministry of Health
        - lacked integration
        - built out APIs
        - used Apigee
            - reduced costs

## Financial Governance in the Cloud
## 

# Fundamentals of cloud cost management

- Cap Ex to Op Ex
- Monitoring is ongoing / daiiy
- Budget is continual

People
Process
Technology

- partnership of finance / tech / business

- GCP native cools for cost monitoring


# Total cost of ownership
Cap Ex: Space, Utils, Hardware, Software, Network, etc.

Op Ex: Pay as you go 
Value: Cloud handles support for Infra


# Best practices for managing Google Cloud costs

1. Identify team that will manage costs
2. Learn difference between invoice / cost tools
3. Cost Management tools for accountability

 - Console has Cost Management Tools

    - visibility 
    - accountability
    - control
    - intelligence

- built-in reporting tools
- custom dashboards
- pricing calculator

control: 
    - authorized individuals to deploy 
    - budgets 
    - alerts 


## Security in the cloud
## 

# Fundamental terms: Privacy, security, compliance and availability
    - privacy   :  data individual has access to and who they can share with
    - security  :  policies procedures and controls to keeep data safe
    - compliance:  meeting 3rd Party standards (healtchare, banking )
    - availability:  how much time data / service is available 99.999%


1. You own your data, not Google
2. Google doesn't sell customer data to 3rd parties 
3. All customer data is encypted by default
4. Google Cloud guards against insider access to your data
5. Google never gives any government entity backdoor access to your data
6. Privacy practices are audited against international standards


# Today's top security challengues
    - phishing attacks
    - physical damage
    - malware / ransomware
    - unsecured 3rd party systems
    - misconfiguration

# Shared Responsibility Model - Part I
   cloud processes data / organization is responsible to control data 
    - customer responsible for access to data
    - cloud provider responsible for physical infrastructure 

    Google Multilayer Security
        - 124 points of presence 
        - 24 data center regions 
            - hardware
                - designs own servers, storage, networking
            - software
                - titan monitors software stack
            - storage
                - encryption at rest
                    - data split into chunks and encrypted with own key (DEK: Data Encryption Key)
                    - Data Encryption Keys are encrypted a 2nd time (wrapped) with another key (KEK: Key Encryption Key)
                  NOTE: if one chunk is compromised,  data is unreadable without other "chunks"
            - identity
                - zero trust model 
            - encryption in transit
            - operations
                - system monitored 24/7


# Shared Responsibility Model - Part II
customers responsibility
    - IT Teams must know who can access what data
        - granular access policies
        - enable MFA 
             - security key

    - IT Teams must have visibility into what and when
        - monitoring and logging

    - How to manage a breach
        - situational awareness
        - culture of stressful situations
        - operational readiness


# Identity and Access Management
    - Cloud Identity: Google IAM

    - IAM Policy 
        - who
            - google account 
            - google group 
            - service account
            - cloud identity / google workspace
        - can do what
            - IAM Role
            - 3 types:
                - Primitive (broad roles)
                    - Owner
                    - Editor
                    - Viewer
                - Predefined
                    - collection of permissions
                        - Compute Engine: 
                                - project
                                - folder
                                - organization
                        - Cloud Big Table :

    Google Cloud Adoption Framework
    cloud.google.com/adoption-framework



 3 Ways to mondernize Infrastructure 
   - VM 
   - Containers
   - Serverless

Kubernetes: open source cluster management system
            automated container orchestration

serverless computing

# Hybrid and multi cloud
 - private cloud: VMs in a private data center
 - hybrid cloud : Combo of private and public
 - multi cloud  : multiple public cloud providers
 
 Open APIs:
    - Cloud Bigtable
    - Cloud Dataproc

 Open Source:
    - TensorFlow
    - Kubernetes
Anthos:
    - build once, run everywhere (really ??)


# How APIs can modernize legacy systems
     -  software that enable integration between systems / services
     -  unlock value without rearchitecting / rebuilding

# Using APIs to create new business vlaue
    - digital ecosystem 
    - create / monetize services

    Apigee:
        - API Services
        - Developer Services
        - Analytics Services


Section 4: Cloud Security and Ops

# Fundamentals of cloud cost management

- Cap Ex to Op Ex
- Monitoring is ongoing / daiiy
- Budget is continual

People
Process
Technology

# Best practices for managing Google Cloud costs

1. Identify team that will manage costs
2. Learn difference between invoice / cost tools
3. Cost Management tools for accountability

# Fundamental terms: Privacy, security, compliance and availability
    - privacy   :  data individual has access to and who they can share with
    - security  :  policies procedures and controls to keeep data safe
    - compliance:  meeting 3rd Party standards (healtchare, banking )
    - availability:  how much time data / service is available 99.999%

   cloud processes data / organization is responsible to control data 

    Google Multilayer Security
        - 124 points of presence 
        - 24 data center regions 
            - hardware
                - designs own servers, storage, networking
            - software
                - titan monitors software stack
            - storage
                - encryption at rest
                    - data split into chunks and encrypted with own key (DEK: Data Encryption Key)
                    - Data Encryption Keys are encrypted a 2nd time (wrapped) with another key (KEK: Key Encryption Key)
                  NOTE: if one chunk is compromised,  data is unreadable without other "chunks"
            - identity
                - zero trust model 
            - encryption in transit
            - operations
                - system monitored 24/7

# Shared Responsibility Model - Part II
customers responsibility
    - IT Teams must know who can access what data
        - granular access policies
        - enable MFA 
             - security key

    - IT Teams must have visibility into what and when
        - monitoring and logging

    - How to manage a breach
        - situational awareness
        - culture of stressful situations
        - operational readiness
