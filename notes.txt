                          -------------+

# Think 10X
    - transformation over improvement 

# Launch and iterate
    - constinuous learning 
        - fail fast
    - figure out solution from by iterating / experimentation
        - don't look for perfect solution first
        - try -> learn -> try
    - correlation between innovative teams and high psychological safety ratesa ## TAKE NOTE
            - ask questions, take risks, challenge each other, build

    More Ideas You Try, The More You Learn

# Example
    - Banking 


What is your Why?
How meeting user expectations ?
How to use technology to serve users 10X ?
How can launch and interate more often?

    - qualities of good data
        - coverage: scope and all possible scenarios
        - clean   : data consistency
                i.e. dirty data:  various timestamp formats
        - complete: availability of sufficient data to replace human knowledge
                incomplete (missing) data can affect model performance


#  AI and ML with Google Cloud

    Do you have your own training data ?
        +----> NO:  Pre-trained APIs
        |
        +----> Yes --->  Are you wirting the model code yourself?
                                    +----> No  ---> AutoML (Vertex AI)
                                    |
                                    +----> Yes ---> Custom Model tooling (Vertx AI)

    - Pre-trained APIs
        -  ML models for analyzing: images, videos, text
                - can be deployed to: on-prem, private cloud, google cloud 

        4 Types:
            - sight:
                - Vision API: pre-trained models to detect: faces, objects, text, sentiment
                                    - use Vision API to assign labels to images + classify
            - language
                - Natual Language API: discovers syntax, entities and sentiment  + classifies (complaints, praise, more info)

            - conversation

# Infrastructure Modernizaton
 - On Prem / Legacy is not a differentiator 
    - Colocation:  rent part of a datacenter

  Virtual Machine: 
    - better use of resources
    - still a physical capacity limit

  Cloud:
    - Infrastructure as a Service
    - Planform as a Service


# Understanding compute options in the cloud
 Cloud:
   - on demand self services
   - broad network access
   - resource pooling
   - rapid elasticity
   - measured service

 3 Ways to mondernize Infrastructure 
   - VM 
   - Containers
   - Serverless

 Hypervisor: between physical and virtual machines

 Container virtualizes the OS
     - more lightweight
     - less memory
     - predicatble env

Kubernetes: open source cluster management system
            automated container orchestration
            - improve app reliability
            - faster / agile app development

serverless computing
    - provisioned automatically


# Hybrid and multi cloud
 - private cloud: VMs in a private data center
 - hybrid cloud : Combo of private and public
 - multi cloud  : multiple public cloud providers
 

 Open APIs:
    - Cloud Bigtable
    - Cloud Dataproc

 Open Source:
    - TensorFlow
    - Kubernetes

Anthos:
    - build once, run everywhere (really ??)

Network:
 - secure / 40% of world's traffic daily
 - global network 
   - 200 countries 
   - 20  regions 
   - 130 points of access

 Google cloud matches datacenter with renewable energy
    - reduces CO2 for computing


# Google Cloud Compute Solutions

VM:
    - Compute Engine 
        - VMs
            - ex. Spotify used Compute Engine to scale

    - Google Cloud VMWare Engine 
       - managed VMWare service
            - manages infrastructure, networking management services
            - ex. Deutsche Borse Group
                - new private cloud in 40 minutes

    - Bare Metal 
        - 

Conainer
    - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
        - deploy / manage / scale
        - cluster of compute engine instances 


Serverless computing
    - AppEngine 
        - Platform as a Service / Cloud Computing Platform 
            - develop and host web apps
        - managed serverless platform
            - ex. IDEXX: VetConnect 

    - CloudRun 
        - build and deploy any langs
        - instantly scale up and down
            - ex. Veolia 

    - CloudFunctions 
        - build and connect cloud services
        - Function as a Service
            - zero server management  
            - ex. Lucille Games


## Modernizing Applications with Google Cloud
## 


# Cloud Change Patterns
5 Patterns:
    1. Move apps first and then change them later
            - lift / shift / change
    2. Change apps before they move
            - make modernization changes on prem first
    3. Invent in greenfield 
            - new infra in cloud  
    4. Invent in brownfield 
            - build in cloud, replace on prem when ready
    5. Move apps without any changes 
            - lift / shift 
            - upgrade infra only (more storage)
            - DR


# Challenges in app dev
    - on prem problems > cloud problems
    - cloud == NO LEGACY
    - decompose monoliths to microservices
    - CI / CD
    - High Velocity Delivery

# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
    - kubernetes: container orchestration system / Open Source
        - deployment 
        - scaling 
        - management

GKE: Google Managed Service for Containers
    - deploy / update / manage 


# App Engine
     - scalable web apps and mobile backends 
     - infrastructure is managed ( no servers )
     - App Engine will scale depending on traffic

ex. EDP: power utility 
         > 400 apps
        legacy mobile app migrated to App Engine



## The Value of APIs
## 

# Legacy System Challenges
    ex. HR / Banking /  Government /  DB / Datawarehouse
    - Does not integrate with IoT or Mobile
    - Batch based

# How APIs can modernize legacy systems
     -  software that enable integration between systems / services
     -  unlock value without rearchitecting / rebuilding

# Using APIs to create new business vlaue
    - digital ecosystem 
    - create / monetize services

ex. Walgreens 
    - Photo development
        - film to phone printing
    - Created APIs to print from phone
    - API was a product

ex. Monex 
    - financial services
    - API to simplify creating new services
    - Published API
    - Couldn't handle onprem / used Apigee

# Apigee
    - legacy system of record cannot keep up with rate of change for apps

        - secure
        - scale
        - manage
        - connect
        - analyze

    Apigee:
        - API Services
        - Developer Services
        - Analytics Services

    ex.  Chile Ministry of Health
        - lacked integration
        - built out APIs
        - used Apigee
            - reduced costs
